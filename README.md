# Simulation-of-HL-ATLASexperiment
Being ATLAS one of the biggest collaborations and experiments when it come to particle physics research, the following upgrades being undertaken at CERN for the following years will generate a higher amount of data and not all of it can be stored. The presented project here simulates the conditions of the ATLAS experiment under Hilgh Luminosity conditions, the software is programmed to annalyse in real time which collisions of particles have a bigger probability of being a significant event with meaningful data worth analysing further or, if on the other hand this collisions provide no extra value to the research and hence are discarded from storing.
